# Hospital Appointment Booking System

## Problem Statement
Managing hospital appointments manually using registers or phone calls often leads to issues like double-booking, long waiting times, missing records, and difficulty in tracking doctor availability. This problem can besolved by simple computer-based system that can manage patient details, doctor schedules, and appointment bookings in an organized way.
